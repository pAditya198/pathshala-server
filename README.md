# Project Description 

Amidst the COVID-19 induced worldwide lockdown that we find ourselves in, We realised that remote learning is the way forward for any form of teaching, and learning activities. Hence , the need to shift to an online or virtual classroom. 

We found out that all of the platforms that the teachers use for connecting to their students are primarily Video Conferencing apps and are not made keeping a teaching platform in mind.
All these platforms were designed to hold meetings and demanded teachers and students to adjust rather than changing themselves.  
Keeping in mind that the institutes across the country are considering an option of conducting a whole semester online, a platform that could conduct classes regularly for 3-5 hours daily was required and the Video Conferencing apps that are already existing use up a lot of data. Our main focus today was to build a platform that could do the same, be effective and require less bandwidth so that the internet does not become a hindrance in the process of learning rather than facilitating it.

Hence, we decided to make 'Pathshala' - a remote teaching app built around classrooms. Streaming slides has always been a hassle where teachers are required to project their screen, thereby consuming a lot of bandwidth. Considering that there arenâ€™t a lot of frame changes while teaching and only the slides need to be changed after some duration. We would be using WebSockets to project a screen of PDF that the teacher is projecting to all the students, thereby removing the need to project multiple frames every second. New slides are sent only when the teacher changes slides. This can save A LOT of bandwidth, and hence, making education more accessible to all.
